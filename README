# Boiler

This is a simple boilerplate for me to use when developing simple websites using gulp. feel free to use it as you want.

To initialize, run 'npm install'. Your working directory is in the /app folder. Run 'gulp watch' to start gulp and auto-reload you page whenever you save a .html, .scss, or .js file. Run 'gulp build' to build and minify/optimize your code/images and put it into a new 'dist' folder.

Have fun!
