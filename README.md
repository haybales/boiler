# Boiler

This is a simple boilerplate to use when developing simple websites using gulp. Feel free to use it as you want.

To initialize, run 'npm install'. Your working directory is in the /app folder. Run 'gulp watch' to start gulp and auto-reload your page whenever you save a .html, .scss, or .js file. Run 'gulp build' to build and minify/optimize your code/images and put it into a new 'dist' folder. Oh yeah, also make sure that you have a recent version of node.js and npm installed.

Have fun!
